Ate the best falafels in the world, went to Temple of Hercules, walked the salty beaches of the Dead Sea, haggled in the street markets, and visited castles that go back to the time of the Romans."

It's a bustling city and walking everywhere got tiring. The museums are great until you realize almost all of these treasures should really go back to where they're from..."

We visited the Louvre, went up the Eiffel Tower, went to a few museums, saw a live Jazz band playing, and ate food from around the world. This was where she first tried falafel and fell in love with it. This was also where she ate pho for the first time. What an unforgettable time I've had here with Joana."
